# pixel-blaster
A repository that is a project of a game called "Pixel Blaster" in Javascript Language.

Be sure that the game is currently unfinished, you'll see that the game is too kind when you are at the pro-like state of playing, and too cruel when you dies.
Yet playing this game for too long can ruin your finger, be warned.
I'll suppose to add a weapon that is more finger friendly, and customizable characters.

How to run this game?

Download cocos latest version : http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download
Unzip then go to the folder with command line (cd -folder name-), run 
=python setup.py
(Python 2.7.x required, not version 3 at all)

Go to folder of this project if cloned via command line (cd -folder name-)
Then run cocos project
=cocos run -s main.js

The window of the project will open automatically, enjoy.

	-need blink invincible for ten seconds.
	
-The game can broke your finger the longer you play,

	-need to add extra temporary weapons, uncommon drops
		-laser - click to activate/deactivate last twenty seconds
		-rapid fire - hold to rapid fire
		-homing missile - click to launch to the nearest enemy.
		-nuke - immediately kills all enemy on screen, a rare drop
		
-May separate as story and arcade(endless) modes

	-The story mode will tell the humorous awaken of the robot player
		and the pointless urge to survive
	-Self insert

		-second boss at level ten, the queen of hive
		-third boss at level fifteen,

			-the alien king second gundam form
			-the alien queen, hidden boss after unlocks all arcade achivements
	-the ending will pretty much sends the player character somewhere bright and heavenly
		telling the player that you've found 'the place to stay'
	
I think the current enemy types are enough? Maybe add just two more.
