# pixel-blaster
A repository that is a project of a game called "Pixel Blaster" in Javascript Language.

Be sure that the game is currently unfinished, you'll see that the game is too kind when you are at the pro-like state of playing, and too cruel when you dies.
Yet playing this game for too long can ruin your finger, be warned.
I'll suppose to add a weapon that is more finger friendly, and customizable characters.

How to run this game?

Download cocos latest version : http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download
Unzip then go to the folder with command line (cd -folder name-), run 
=python setup.py
(Python 2.7.x required, not version 3 at all)

Go to folder of this project if cloned via command line (cd -folder name-)
Then run cocos project
=cocos run -s main.js

The window of the project will open automatically, enjoy.

I think the current enemy types are enough? Maybe add just two more.
